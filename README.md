# Simple-distance-vector-routing-sim
This is a simple simulation of distance vector routing algorithm to understand how routing tables are updated.

### Points to note
1.  Router names are stored as characters, for the ease of understanding.
2.  We assume that routers are updated sequentially (0 -> n-10).
    You can replace router updation sequence by chaning routerUpdate().
